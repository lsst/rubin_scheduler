def calc_season(ra, mjd, mjd_start=None, calc_diagonal=False):
    """Calculate the season (of visibility) in the survey
    for a series of ra/time values of an observation.

    Based only on the RA of the point on the
    sky, it calculates the 'season' based on when the sun
    passes through this RA (this marks the start of a 'season').


    Parameters
    ----------
    ra : `float` or `np.ndarray` (N,)
        The RA (in degrees) of the point(s) on the sky
    mjd : `np.ndarray`, (M,)
        The times of the observations, in MJD days
    mjd_start : `float`, optional
        The time of the start of the survey.
        Default None will use `rubin_scheduler.utils.survey_start_mjd()`.
    calc_diagonal : `bool`, optional
        If True AND if len(mjd) == len(ra), ONLY the 'diagonal'
        elements of the seasons will be calculated.
        That is: RA and mjd are assumed to be paired and the resulting
        seasons will be a  1-d `np.array` of dimension (N,).

    Returns
    -------
    seasons : `np.array`, (M,) or `np.array` (N, M)
        The season values, as either a 1-d or 2-d array, depending on
        the value passed for ra and calc_diagonal.


    Notes
    -----
    Seasons should be calculated using the RA of a fixed point
    on the sky, such as the slice_point['ra'] if calculating season
    values for a series of opsim pointings on the sky, rather
    than the value for each visit.

    To convert to integer seasons, use np.floor(seasons).

    "Season 0" will be the first (full) season after the RA value becomes
    visible for the first time after mjd_start.
    This induces a "discontinuity" in the resulting season values,
    corresponding to the RA where the survey started -- like the international
    dateline (in this case, where season goes from
    'past season' to 'new season').

    The scheduler `season_calc` routine computes "season" independently,
    and may have a 90 degree offset in the location of this 'skip'/zeropoint,
    plus requires different calculation of `offset` values to account for
    location on the sky.
