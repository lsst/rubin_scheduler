        An array with values of 1 or zero. One element per night, value of

        An array of floats with the fractional season value.
        Season values range from 0-1 for the first season;
        0.5 would be the "peak" of seasonal visibility.

        Number of sequences to try to place into each season.
        Default of 30.
    min_season_length : `float`, optional

        season. Default of 0 currently doesn't discard any seasons,
        on the basis that most of the short season concerns will be
        early in the survey and we'd rather have some observations early

    Parameters
    ----------
    ddf_name : `str`
        The name of the DDF, used to identify visits scheduled for each DDF.
    ddf_RA : `float`
        The RA of the DDF, used to calculate the season values. In degrees.
    ddf_grid : `np.array`
        An array with info for the DDFs. Generated by the
        rubin_scheduler.scheduler/surveys/generate_ddf_grid.py` script
        The time spacing in this is approximately 15 or 30 minutes,
        and includes visits which may be during twilight.
    sun_limit : `float`, optional
        The maximum sun altitude allowed when prescheduling DDF visits.
        In degrees.
    sequence_time : `float`, optional
        Expected time for each DDF sequence, used to avoid hitting the
        sun_limit (running DDF visits into twilight). In minutes.
    airmass_limit : `float`, optional
        The maximum airmass allowed when prescheduling DDF visits.
    sky_limit : `float`, optional
        The maximum skybrightness allowed when prescheduling DDF visits.
        This is a skybrightness limit in g band (mags).
        Default None imposes no limit.
    g_depth_limit : `float`, optional
        The minimum g band five sigma depth limit allowed when prescheduling
        DDF visits. This is a depth limit in g band (mags).
        The depth is calculated using skybrightness from skybrightness_pre,
        a nominal FWHM_500 seeing at zenith of 0.7" (resulting in airmass
        dependent seeing) and exposure time.
        Default 23.5. Set to None for no limit.
    season_unobs_frac : `float`, optional
        Defines the end of the range of the prescheduled observing season.
        season runs from 0 (sun's apparent position is at the RA of the DDF)
        to 1 (sun returns to an apparent position in the RA of the DDF).
        The scheduled season runs from:
        season_unobs_frac < season < (1-season_unobs_fract)
    low_season_frac : `float`, optional
        Defines the end of the range of the "low cadence" prescheduled
        observing season.
        The "standard cadence" season runs from:
        low_season_frac < season < (1 - low_season_frac)
        For an 'accordian' style DDF with fewer observations near
        the ends of the season, set this to a value larger than
        `season_unobs_frac`. Values smaller than `season_unobs_frac`
        will result in DDFs with a constant rate throughout the season.
    low_season_rate : `float`, optional
        Defines the rate to use within the low cadence portion
        of the season. During the standard season, the 'rate' is 1.
        This is used in `ddf_slopes` to define the desired number of
        cumulative observations for each DDF over time.
    mjd_start : `float`, optional
        The MJD of the start of the survey. Used to identify the
        starting point when counting seasons.
        Default None uses `survey_start_mjd()`.
