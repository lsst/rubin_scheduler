=============================
Skybrightness (Precalculated)
=============================

The `rubin_scheduler.skybrightness_pre` module generates and accesses pre-calculated skybrightness values
over the sky in each bandpass during the expected on-sky period for LSST. The values calculated
by the rubin_sim.skybrightness module are packaged into data files which are then read and passed to
the scheduler by rubin_sim.skybrightness_pre.
